# Print Yourself

Print Yourself is an experimental link-in-bio tool, where the data lives in the URL.

The idea is to make it easy to share links to your social media profiles, and other links, without having to use a third party service.

The data is stored in the URL, and can be shared as a link.

## How to use

1. Go to [print-yourself.vercel.app](https://print-yourself.vercel.app)
2. Add your links
3. Share the link

## How it works

The data is stored in the URL, and can be shared as a link.

The data is stored in the URL as a query string, and the data is encoded as a base64 string.
